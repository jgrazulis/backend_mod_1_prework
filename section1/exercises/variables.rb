# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

says = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
p says


# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = 22 + 2
p students

students = 22 - 2
p students


first_name = "Mia"
is_hungry = "Mia always"
number_of_pets = 1
p first_name, is_hungry, number_of_pets

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
#I decided to use strings for the first and second variables because I was thinking of my dog's name. For the third variable, "number" is included in the name so I used an integer.

# Explain.


# YOU DO:
first_name = "Jessica"
is_hungry = "Mia"
number_of_pets = 3
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets
# print all three variables to the terminal.


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
p healthy_snacks
p junk_food_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
