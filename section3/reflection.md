## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I was not familiar with the terminology of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) and understand now how friends that have attended Turing in the past explain that there will be work around things you have not yet learned! Not being afraid to seek help definitely resonated with me. This is something I have struggled with in the past, but through grad school and life experiences I am starting to improve on. I expect the Turing workload will force me to confront that issue head on. 

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I currently do create SMART goals as they are helpful to me in accomplishing things I set out to do. As mentioned above, I am always working to be better at asking for help.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is a data set that contains key-value pairs and can store any type of objects, whereas arrays can only store integers.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

`pet_store = 
{
"dog_food" => 115
"dog_toys" => 237
"dog_treats" => 55
"cat_food" => 75
cat_toys => 302
cat_treats => 52
}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`states.value[2]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

`pet_store.keys
pet_store.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

A grocery store could also use a hash to store all of the inventory. It may be easier to access the data since there are so many different types of food a grocery story can hold.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

I am still a little confused on when a hash is a better option than an array in terms of the examples given here like in the case of inventory when integers are used.
